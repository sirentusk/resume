                    <p>This course teaches Teeline shorthand, which is a system of fast writing. Participants will learn to omit unnecessary letters and streamline longhand letters. Advanced principles for speedwriting are covered from week 11. On the final evening speeds of 40+ non-standard or 60+ standard words per minute under the Australian Standard 2907 may be attempted. This course is for journalists, editors, personal assistants, students or anyone needing to learn how to write fast.</p>

                <p>Why use containers with your .NET Core applications? When you write an application, you have to consider the application code, frameworks, packages, and the underlying operating system itself. Using Docker allows you to encapsulate everything you need to run an application, with all its dependencies, in one nice, neat package that you can replicate on any machine or workstation, as many times as you need. In this course, Shayne Boyer and Lisa Guthrie start with the very basics of Docker, covering the concepts and practical uses, then move on to integrating Docker with Visual Studio to help you containerize your apps with just a few clicks. Finally, Shayne and Lisa show you a simple way to publish your containerized web app.</p>

Join Morten Rand-Hendriksen as he takes a deep dive into the past, present, and future of web fonts. Morten covers everything from the origins of the words "lowercase" and "uppercase" to why variable fonts can help solve modern web font performance issues.

                    <p>Indepth knowledge of email <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-email-routing/">routing</a> and free <a href="https://www.emailvendorselection.com/smtp-relay-deliverability/">SMTP servers</a>.</p>
                    <p>Currently I am using <a href="https://www.mailjet.com/">Mailjet</a> with Cloudflare, which gives you 100 free email addresses and 6000 messages per month and its upgrades are priced well. It allows you to validate your website through DNS TXT files.</p>
                    <p>The benefits to this kind of service is that you can direct all of your separate emails to one address and then reply as whichever address you like. Alongside this you can see whether your email has been opened.</p>
                    <p>How it works is that Cloudflare allows you to receive in emails and Mailjet lets you them send out as any Alias email address. So, I get my emails delivered to Cloudflare (all my email addresses) which then it sends to one email address with any host (hotmail, protonmail, etc). Then when sending out, the STMP settings are set to Mailjet servers rather than the host so I can select multiple email reply <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/using-identities">Identities</a> in Thunderbird. Ie, I receive email to address A, I reply from address B, pretending to be address C. I only need to have 1 email address but appear to have many.</p>

                <p>I have been involved in learning and using more advanced styles of English such as in Journalism (for example print, radio and TV) at <a href="#journalism">college</a>, <a href="#bachelor">university</a> and <a href="#freelance">institutes</a>, and learning the integrals of <a href="#business">Business English</a> and requirements for using <a href="#bachelor">Academic English</a> in a variety of styles in Tertiary education.</p>
                <p>I have also learnt to use more niche cross-cultural communication skills in private life, in the <a href="#work">workplace</a> and within <a href="#tesol">education</a>. I have researched and experienced a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolect">ethnolects</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolect#Greek_Australian_English_(Greek_ethnolect)">greek</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_in_Australian_English#Lebanese_Australian_English">lebanese</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220520163436/https://honisoit.com/2019/08/omagoor-the-quest-for-the-asian-australian-accent/">chinese</a>, etc) growing up in Western Sydney and find linguistics interesting.

I have a more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnioDeQNlxQ">cultivated</a> Australian accent, yet I love playing with a Western Sydney lower class dialect. I can minimise my accent to foreigners, being able to be heard very clearly (to the point where once an online Japanese student, whom had prior lived in Australia, even argued with me that I wasn't Australian), to having a thick multicultural Westie accent with specifically chosen masculine vernacular. I love to watch people's reactions to each vernacular and accent strength chosen.</p>

                <summary>Perspicacity ‚Ü´</summary>
                <p>I have an incredibly good knowledge of people relations.</p>
                <p>I am generally well loved in most social environments that I've found myself a part of. "Making people smile," is generally my superpower when used. It has been that way since I was a child. I believe this stems from high perspicacity, an observance of my external environment.</p>
                <p>I like to intake a large amount of data from the environment and seem to adjust my personality based on the stimuli from around me. Ie, I act more reserved amongst those reserved and more outgoing amongst those extroverted. Adaptable, and therefore tolerated on a friend level by a much wider demographic than is the norm.</p>
                <p>I can walk into a room and make friends with totally unrelated people - buddies with the narcissistic banker, the criminal thief, the soft elderly lady and the conservative religious figure. Friends with the strict rule-abider and the wild rule-breaker.</p>
                <p>I can vary my intelligence, vocabulary, class, etc - based on whom I am interacting with. I feel as comfortable at an opera as I do fitting in with rambunctious homeless kids. I adapt.</p>
                <p>This makes me great with clients, but, can be difficult in long-term relations with those very different to me whom seek for me to remain in a personality more similar to their own as more than just acquaintences as I always revert back to the Self.</p>

                <p>I taught online on this platform for approximately six months before starting an in-person teaching role. I teach here still casually to a small amount of students.</p>
                <p>Preply is an International platform where I mostly taught expats living in Australia and wishing to integrate into Australian culture and learn Aussie English.</p>
                <p>Specifics in my role were helping to fix accent issues, aiding with listening to the Australian accent (slang, speeding up listening, tonal differences between dialects, etc), alongside normal English teaching (grammar, vocabulary, conjunctions, root word etymology differences, phrasal verbs, etc).</p>

                <p>I taught approximately 400 classes to small groups of Chinese students online on this platform. Alo7 operates by pairing a native teacher with individual schools in China. Schools pairing clumps of 2-5 children with a teacher for 10 week blocks of group lessons.</p>
                <p><b>What I learnt</b> üß†</p>
                <p>Obtained a 4.93/5 star rating from 2730 reviews out of 5618 classes over a 2 year period. I mostly taught Japanese adults, though sometimes to koreans or taiwanese and occasionally children, on DMM & Engoo.</p>
                <p>I taught English to a mixture of business professionals as intermediate-to-advanced learners looking to grow their English skills for employment and travel. Occasionally also beginner children to supplement their mandatory English school education. Many students book me who are looking to push the limits of their English speaking and listening ability.</p>
                <p>DMM (outsourced company) - My teaching profile was registered on both engoo.com and dmm.com. Bibo Global (old) / Engoo (changed their formal name to product name) - Contract was signed. 95% of students originated from DMM but the formal hire company outsourcing teachers was Bibo Global / Engoo.</p>

                <p>I run multiple websites and have done this as a professional hobby since my early 20s. It has given me a lot of IT skills through self developing projects and fixing niche website issues and coding.</p>
                <p>I developed indepth comparative understanding of website hosts, hosting regulations and laws for NSFW content and regulations such as the GDPR in europe. Currently some of my web servers are located in the Netherlands for GDPR protection as an example through a UK company. Some are hosted through cloudflare for the smaller websites for free hosting using "workers" and email routing.</p>
                <p>I learnt FTP transfers (filezilla) early on as some hosts failed to offer free migrations for multiple websites (my first website I developed in 2013 and worked on it about 10 hours a day providing services for people, etc) and then using specific tools like CDNs later on. I also had an online secondhand bookshop website using shopify for a period of time. I mostly used Wordpress.org throughout my time and have only stepped back into coding (after learning HTML at high school) much later in life through LinkedinLearning and then later through two TAFE NSW courses.</p>

                <p>I am involved in developing Royalty Free photography on a freelance basis. I learnt specific photography skills through my Diploma of Journalism unit Photojournalism where we were given $10,000 cameras to learn to use.</p>
                <p>Though I was always very keen on photography from a young age. From my first real tax return as a young teen at about 16 I purchased a digital camera as an example of my early enthusiasm. Nature and people enrapture me.</p>

                <p>Whilst studying I was involved in Article Writing. When I learn a new skill I write an article explaining how to do it for other people - and also for myself in the future if the skill is ever unlearnt so I can quickly relearn the task. I noticed within IT fields, that I obtain very technical knowledge that is very hard to remember if not reapplied often. As is the case with all memory, but the more technical a task the easier it is to remember all required steps in the task. So I write articles to aid future me, and other people with the same problem. Writing was my first choice of career, as I wrote novellas whilst at high school. So writing will always be a part of my life in some form or another. Whether with a coded language, or as a translator, as an event speaker, as a writer, as a teacher, etc.</p>
                <p>I tend to fall back on writing as an important skill set in my career and roles where I can perform some form of wordsmithing tend to fit me better - where something I ‚Äúcreate‚Äù has an effect on people. I prefer to be in the background and have my creations speak for me - my physical or vocal words affecting people. Website design itself is a fantastic way to let my physical creation speak for me - the beauty of the code showing my wordsmith abilities as an example of this skill.</p>
                <p>I enjoying ‚Äúcreating through letters and numbers‚Äù would be a summary. Whether sitting for hours trying to find the exact perfect word to make a sentence flow, or sitting for hours trying to find that one extra layer of code, find that one ‚Äúinteractive bug‚Äù which makes people addict to your creation - both involve the same part of the brain. It‚Äôs perfectionism in creativity - I just find language itself the tool my brain looks to but also I enjoy colour (I believe I probably have <a href="https://research.ncl.ac.uk/tetrachromacy/faqs/" target="_blank">Tetrachromacy</a> so I become highly responsive to perfect colour matching - I can tell if colours are even slightly differentiated), and I enjoy mathematic visual symmetry, etc. I understand what ‚Äúlooks good‚Äù to differently layers of person. Person ‚Äúa‚Äù differentiates from person ‚Äúb‚Äù but they may have overlapping subconscious concepts, I love to over emphasise each layer of differentiation sometimes. I love learning about subcultures, class structures, brain psychological variants. </p>

                <p>Whilst working here I was the intermediatary between the Head Office staff and the individual store franchisees. So department heads would call Head Office with orders to be fulfilled and to be directed to the Head Office staff. I enjoyed the professionalism and building repore with the franchisees. Learning to be talkative but not overly to build repore. It was a nice workplace.</p>
                <p>I left due to the internal politics because outside of my interest at the time.</p>

                <p>Tried out a bakery apprenticeship, after working in a bakery at Coles in earlier years.</p>
                <p>I tried out this role because I had a good familiarity with Bakers. I "liked" bakers. I found them interesting and could see myself in the role of "working late night to early morning" and many other facets of the job.</p>
                <p>I lasted about a year in this career, I lived a decent distance from my job and was paid very poorly - less than I had outside of the apprenticeship of course. I was living out of home and it was becoming unfeasable.

                <p>This position involved door-to-door sales. I tried this job as the product being sold was "green energy" which was a fascination for me at the time - being reasonably farleft and nihilistic as is common in late teens. So I endevoured to see whether I could do door-to-door sales. It was very rough.</p>
                <p>During this time period, I started quite a few jobs to see whether it was something I liked.</p>
                <p><b>What I learnt</b> üß†</p>
                <p>I learnt that I am very neutral in my disposition for things. I find it very difficult to sell something that I don't believe in as a product. For an example, in this case I was trying to switch people from energy companies, which is a very serious decision to make. And of course as you can see, the company did go defunct. Customers would suggest this to me at the time, I found it fascinating to listen to people's reasons for saying no.</p>
                <p>I am a "resolver of problems" personality, rather than a "push problems under the rug" kind of person. If someone says a problem to me, I don't think of finding a way around it to make them purchase something, I think of how I could give feedback to the company to elleviate this problem - if the problem, in my estimation, is actually a flaw. I want to "fix things" as a summary, make something optimal enough that people want to buy it, not need to force people into purchasing an item.</p>
                <p>It was useful for me to see how sales worked in the "cold" sense. Very brutal line of work. Great respect for those whom are skilled in it. I realise I do have the skill, I can see you any "idea" and make you believe it, but my machiavellian skills do not work when I am logically given a more valid answer than my own that is actually correct. I respect intelligence and knowledge. Luckily for me it happens less often due to my deep thoughtfulness leading to answering most basic assumptions before I encounter a debate. When it happens, I tend to enjoy it, as my brain loves learning about problems to fix.</p>

                <p>I worked in two departments and in two stores over the five years. I temporarily relocated to a new store (Rouse Hill) when it freshly opened and needed staff at the end of my time with the company. Initially I was operating a register, handling money and processing purchases, whilst giving customer service through store knowledge.</p>
                <p>I sought to have an index of memories for all locations of items in the store for stock return and customer enquiries. The secondary department I worked in was the bakery department. Role consisted of packing consumables, alongside producing small items like icing cakes and making donuts. Whilst in the bakery for 2 years I worked early weekend hours 5am-2pm, during my later teenage years.</p>

                <p>That industriousness is useful. Whilst I moaned as a child sometimes about doing it, I realised that I always liked the money afterwards. That developing some kind of routine helped, to make it less arduous, like multitasking whilst doing it and letting my brain wander.</p>
                <p>It let me appreciate monotony which I would say is an integral part of my personality today. Being able to do routine tasks whilst my brain is doing hundreds of other things conversely to stop the boredom. I actually learnt to enjoy monotony.</p>
                <p>Many people have that anecdote, "I thought of my best idea on the toilet," "I thought of this great idea whilst doing the dishes," "my best ideas always come to me in bed," and more instances such as these. I learnt that having some monotony at work was very useful for me.</p>

                <summary>Entry</summary>
                <p>Only one test score needs to be above the threshold on either of the Cattell tests to gain entry into the Mensa Institute. So I was 1 point (0.2%) off acceptance with a score of 131 as the top 97.3%, rather than 97.5% (admission rounds up to the 98% threshold), of the average human population.</p>
                <p>I only did the test once. IQ tests generally take multiple times to <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/confidence-interval/">approximate</a> an accurate score, depending on the test will be how many times you need to do it. As no test is perfect. So if I took the test again, it is extremely likely I would gain at least 1 IQ point and be admitted into Mensa. It‚Äôs on my bucket list of things to do.</p>

                <summary>Breakdown</summary>
                <p>As top 3% of the population, the calculation is 97.3657942589%, which you can see <a href="https://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/IQtable.aspx">here</a> in the .16 Standard Deviation (SD) column. This means I am 1 in 38 people. So in a randomised room of 100 people representing the average human population there would be 2-3 people of my IQ in the room or higher.</p>
                <p>Though humans generally pool in certain areas based on professions for IQ so there is not a normal population distribution in most environments.</p>

                <p>The two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Current_tests">tests</a> I did were the CFIT-III-A and the CFIT-III-B. Which use the .16 and .24 <a href="https://inomics.com/blog/standardizing-the-data-of-different-scales-which-method-to-use-1036202">deviation</a> scale.</p>
                <p>The tests are testing Gf and Gc. Which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence">General Fluid Intelligence and General Crystalline Intelligence</a>. CFIT stands for Culture Fair Intelligence Test, and III means it is for Adults and A and B are types.</p>
                <p>Due to my <a href="">high openness</a> scores, I was told by a psychologist in Germany to do the Cattell Culture Fair test. As it would be best suited to test my intelligence quotient compared to the other IQ tests.</p>
                <p>I chose to do the test in the UK where the Cattell test is the default IQ test for the country - The US branch of Mensa provides it as a secondary option, but the test is older and hasn't been updated in a while. Alongside that, I was living in Germany at the time, which is further from Australia, America, and Canada than the UK to take an English instructed test.</p>

                <p>"According to David Geary, gf and gc can be traced to two separate brain systems. Fluid intelligence involves both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and other systems related to attention and short-term memory. Crystallized intelligence appears to be a function of brain regions that involve the storage and usage of long-term memories, such as the hippocampus." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence#Neuroanatomy">Fluid and crystallized intelligence Neuroanatomy</a>.</p>
                <p>"Fluid reasoning (Gf): includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures...

                <p>"Though distinct, there is interaction, as fluid intelligence is a determining factor in the speed with which crystallised knowledge is accumulated (Cattell, 1963).</p>
                <p>Crystallised intelligence is known to increase with age as we accumulate knowledge throughout the lifespan.

                <p>My prior CPU had been overheating something fierce continuously when I was trying to multitask so figured it was time for the upgrade.</p>
                <p>This is my first Ryzen and I waited a few years till the decent ones dropped down to a better price. I liked that caseking sent me candy in the box as well, I love sour worms ‚ò∫Ô∏è.</p>

                <p>When traveling from Australia to China the yellow chassis PC arrived fine. When repacking my bags and trying to make sure my PC was very securely placed by pushing it down against the soft things under it. I accidentally cracked the window. So the case definitely needed an upgrade.</p>
                <p>I decided to keep my 1060, as it was functioning fine, I thought to get a 3000 series for the next upgrade.</p>
                <p>For this rig, I switched from US to DE keyboards. I like the DE layout slightly better. It's pretty much the same (only y and z are changed on the main letters) but you get more keys as the shift buttons are smaller (so better for keybinding in games arguably as you get one more key next to Z) and also you get more letter types (example, √§) which was useful for me as my suburb in Germany had an umlaut √º.</p>

                <p>Bought a Asus B450M-A motherboard, due to prior B450 AORUS malfunctioning. Pretty common error for it to have from what I was reading, but might have happened during travel.</p>
                <p>Had this problem: <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/1089442-x570-aorus-pro-cold-boot-hangs-on-dram-led/" target="_blank">X570 Aorus Pro cold boot hangs on dram led</a> / <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/952967-red-cpu-dram-light-system-won%C2%B4t-boot/" target="_blank">Red Cpu / Dram Light - System won't boot</a> / X570 Aorus Aorus Wifi Frequent Light.</p>
                <p>Issue was that the PC would just shut itself off randomly and upon restart sometimes the CPU light would be on. Sometimes it would successfully boot back on after switching off different things like the power supply, then the power board, then it would boot. It was weird, it wasn't a CPU issue, as of course it "booted" with no issue sometimes. Replacing the Motherboard rather than the CPU fixed the issue. A glitch somewhere.</p>

                <p>I built this Rig, specifically, to play Warcraft on Ultra graphics. As I had started playing it in my mid 20s.</p>
                <p>I read up a lot about AMD performance with gaming and decided to have a go with it.</p>
                <p>I grew up on Celerons (intel), but I liked AMD for some reason. Probably the Australian "underdog" mentality at the time. Still prefer them to Intel.</p>
                <p>I upgraded to a mATX cause I believed a little bit bigger size would be still able to fit nicely in luggage.</p>

                <p>I first built an ITX because I knew I would be travelling with it. Figured smaller was better for travelling. Was difficult to maintain the heat as one would assume.</p>
                <p>I've always been one to take apart my PC and clean it as a teen. One of my uncles is very tecchy. I remember him and my dad taking me and my younger brother to buy 128mb sticks of ram in Parramatta somewhere in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/5cr2j2/how_much_ram_did_computers_have_over_time_timeline/d9ynds0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"></a>late 90s</a> and being very excited.</p>
                <p>I decided in my 20s that it was time to fully indulge myself into the art of building my own personal Rigs.</p>
                <p>I will add details about this specific Rig later (as they are in some random text file lost somewhere).</p>

                <p>Whilst living near university and using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC">very small</a> laptop, I was a member of an online forum, which is now defunct, but at the time this online social circle was discussing the intrigue of using Kali. As a member of the social circle was using it.</p>
                <p>I remembering installing and using it, learning its GUI and playing around with it. Seemed like an enjoyable operating system from my decade old memory. The "hacker OS" as its aptly called. I remember sitting in the public library, on my laptop, playing with it one day. I had befriended the computer shop employee who worked across the road from the Library in the small town the University was in, so I spent some time in the Library and the Computer repair store whilst living in the town.</p>

                    <p>Went to Mensa USA in Arlington to do an IQ test - ended up paying to do the two tests instead of just the cattel.</p>
                    <p>Realised after returning to Mexico that US Mensa only let residents join and my residence was set to Mexico.</p>
                    <p>Cause I intended to use the results to join a different Mensa - as I wasn't planning to remain in the Americas.</p>

                    <p>Needed to renew my 6 month entry visa to Mexico at some point anyway, so it was okay.</p>
                    <p>Was my fault for trying to be cheap and not go back to the UK which was my plan. For some reason, I just always get pulled back to the UK.</p>

                    <p>Lived inside in the hostel for a few weeks, then moved into the "tent city" attached to the hostel. I actually really liked living in the tent. I would go sit inside, use the wifi and my juicer, talk to people and then go out and sleep in the tent. I liked it so much, in the nsw weather, that I decided to continue doing it when returning to Sydney in a backyard. With an extension cord giving electricity from the main house and a mattress, microwave, laptop, etc in it. I like the feeling of aloneness in a tent. I like the "living in a sunroom" concept. I get very caught up in tech and being on my PC that I feel sometimes its useful to have nature "forced" on me.</p>
